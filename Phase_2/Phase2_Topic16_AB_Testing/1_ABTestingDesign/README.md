# A/B Testing Design

A/B Testing introduction! Walks through doing a test and how statistical power and effect size relate to this.

## Learning Goals

- Understands how A/B testing relates to hypothesis testing
- Understands the considerations in designing an A/B test
- Explains how to conduct an A/B test

## Lecture Materials

[Jupyter Notebook: A/B Testing Introduction](ab_testing_introduction.ipynb)

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction to A/B Testing (10 Mins)

Relate A/B testing with hypothesis tests and when A/B tests can be appropiate. Make sure to bring it back to communicating with stakeholders being a big importance.

### Designing an Experiment (20 Mins)

Go through what should be considered for an A/B test experiment. Introduce statistical power & effect size in relation to sample size for A/B test (power analysis).

### Example A/B Test (20 Mins)

Walk through a fake scenario using chi-square tests and overall coming to a conclusion based on criteria from fake stakeholders and hypothesis tests.

### Conclusion (10 Mins)

Open Q&A.
