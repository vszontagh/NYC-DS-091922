# A/B Testing Analysis

A/B testing focused lecture after already introducing A/B testing. Ultimately allows students to perform A/B test as an exercise with a group.

## Learning Goals

- Conduct an A/B test in Python
- Interpret the results of the A/B tests for a stakeholder

## Lecture Materials

[Jupyter Notebook: A/B Testing](ab_testing.ipynb)

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 Mins)

Discuss how we've already learned what A/B tests are and what we must consider.

### A/B Test Example Together (20 Mins)

Work through an example A/B test mostly focusing on processing the data and creating a hypothesis test (chi-square)/ This ltimately leading to a conclusion that could be presented to a business stakeholder.

### Exercise (25 Mins)

Have them practice in groups with the same data but a different question (either assign or have them come up with one) and come back to the class. They then share what they found and how they can interpret their findings to stakeholder.

### Conclusion (10 Mins)

Allow for a group share with some or all of the groups (time permitting).
