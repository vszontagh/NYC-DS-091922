        <h1>Paradise Lost: Book IV</h1>
        <div class="milton-excerpt">
            <p>Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,<br />

            The Tempter ere th'Accuser of man-kind, [ 10 ] <br />
            To wreckon innocent frail man his loss<br />
            Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:<br />
            Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,<br />
            Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br />
            
           <span class = "classic_quote">Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth [ 15 ]</span> <br />
            Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, <br />
            And like a <a href="" id="engine" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="devilish">devillish</span> Engine</a> back recoiles<br />
            Upon himself; horror and doubt distract<br />
            His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr<br />
            
            <span class="classic_quote", id = "hell_within_himself">The Hell within him, for within him Hell [ 20 ]<br />
            He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br />
            One step no more from himself can fly <br />
            By change of place</span>: Now conscience wakes despair<br />
            That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie <br />
            
            Of what he was, wha>t is, and what must be <br />
            Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.<br />
            Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view<br />
            Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,<br />
            Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,<br />
